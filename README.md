# Civic Social Media

## About
The Civic Social Media project of the Civic Interaction Design research group at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences focuses on researching, designing, and promoting digital platforms that enable community members to communicate, collaborate, and exchange information safely and reliably.


## About the project
This project has developed various products that help designers and policymakers develop and design Civic Social Media. These have been compiled in PDFs and can be downloaded from our website. The aim of this project is to transform these PDF documents into an interactive, accessible online experience that inspires users and enables them to apply Civic Social Media concepts in their own context.
