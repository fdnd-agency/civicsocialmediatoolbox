### Gather Data - The good the bad and the uglie (#121)
#### Instructions
Put up three sections labeled ‘The Good’, ‘The Bad’ and ‘The Ugly’. Give everyone 5 minutes to note down one or more things per category from the last sprint. One aspect per post-it.

### Generate insights - Wish grantedn (#50)
#### Instructions
Give participants 2 minutes to silently ponder the following question: 'A fairy grants you a wish that will fix your biggest problem at work overnight. What do you wish for?' Follow up with: 'You come to work the next morning. You can tell, that the fairy has granted your wish. How do you know? What is different now?' If trust within the group is high, let everyone describe their 'Wish granted'-workplace. If not, just tell the participants to keep their scenario in mind during the next phase and suggest actions that work towards making it real.

**Yamen**

**Abeer**

### Decide what to do - Pitch (#73)
#### Instructions
Ask everyone to think of 2 changes they'd like to implement and write them down on separate index cards. Draw 2 slots on the board. The first team member puts their favorite change idea into the first slot. His neighbor puts their favorite into the second slot. The third member has to pitch her favorite idea against the one already hanging that she favors less. If the team prefers her idea, it's swapped against the hanging one. This continues until everyone has presented both their cards.

De Third member heeft gekozen voor de groene sticky notes. 

### Close the retrospective - You and me (#102)
#### Instructions
Put up 2 columns on a white board: 'Thank you!' and 'My action'. Ask everybody to write one sticky per column: Something they want to thank another teammate for doing; and something they want to change about their own behavior in the next iteration. It can be something really small. Once everyone is finished, do a round for each person to present their stickies and post them to the board.

# Sprint 16
### Amazon review - Karima

Yamen  
- Title: Difficulties? Not for Yamen
- Nothing seems to be too difficult for you. You’ve made progress on the component progress bar after receiving feedback from the teachers. I also saw improvements of the documentation in the issues, well done!
 
Abeer  
- Title: Solved many things  
- I’ve also seen you develop in a good way during the projects. You ask good questions that are helpful for us. Despite the many times we needed to change the design, you always change the design in the way the client has explained to us. And you’ve made many pull requests this sprint, keep it up!

### Amazon review - Abeer

Karima
-Title: helper
-You help us if we needed help as could as you can and you are a fast writer, so you take the lead to write the feedback that we receive every time from the client. You document your issues in a good way.
 
Yamen
Title: Expert
-The animation that you did for the progress bar is amazing and you started to document what you have done better than before. You have always answers related to code, so when we need something we ask you for help.

### Amazon review - Yamen

Karima  Title: Challenger 
- You follow what the client wants, document everything clearly, and try to learn new things so we can achieve the client’s goals. You also make an effort to explore new topics and tools.

- Abeer Title: Working Under Pressure
- You had many changes to handle in this sprint. You had to learn how to work with data, build pages, and fix the design according to the client’s requests.

### Ask Norman Kerth’s 4 key questions - Karima

What did we do well, that if we didn’t discuss we might forget?
- We update each other daily on what we’ve completed for the project and what still needs to be done. For example, we distribute the code reviews and decide who will handle which one.

What did we learn?
- We’ve tried to implement all the workshops in the project: Component library, the new responsive, container queries, user preferences, rich color palette.

What should we do differently next time?
- Set deadlines for tasks and reviewing pull requests 

What still puzzles us? 
- Helping each other when someone is having a problem.

### Ask Norman Kerth’s 4 key questions - Abeer
What did we do well, that if we didn’t discuss we might forget?
- We use teams to communicate and inform each other about what we did and what we will do. And we divided the user stories between us so everyone did his part.

What did we learn?
- We learn alot of things in this semester. we learned about the new responsive, component library, css nesting, container queries, prefres media, atomic design.

What should we do differently next time?
- make deadlines for reviewing the pull requests.

What still puzzles us? 
- Different speeds: Some work fast, some work carefully.

### Ask Norman Kerth’s 4 key questions - Yamen

- What did we do well, that if we didn’t discuss we might forget?
  the set up we made. Without those, it would be difficult to know what each team member is working on. 
- What did I learn?
 I learned how to write better documentation and how to work more effectively with Svelte, especially when it comes to fetching and handling data.
- What should we do differently next time?
  We need to set clear deadlines for each task we want to complete. 
- What still puzzles us?
  It’s still quite challnging to work with the data the way we need for the project.

# Sprint 17

### Take aways - Yamen
- The most remarkeble thing i've learned during the retro:
- I learned scroll animations with GSAP.
- I also learned how to place a 3D model in my project and make it work with the correct CSS elements.

### Take aways - Abeer
- The most remarkeble thing i've learned during the retro: I learned to work under pressure. We were busy with the creative coding spike and for that we had to make 3 versions in three weeks. We had to learn new things in a short time. Also, we had to work for the client website. 


### Take aways - Karima
- The most remarkeble thing i've learned during the retro: I learned to work with GSAP and learned how to create a small project based on a theme.

### Winning story
Most winning story: User story #

### Reflection
Why do you think the user story won in this category? Reflect on the process of completing the tasks - what went good or wrong.
- Abeer: In this user story you see text that explains it, then the user story is divided into smaller sub-tasks to make the work more structured.
I tested performance and accessibilty in every sub-task. I added clear documentation with foto's and explaination.
- Karima: In this user story all of the steps are included. First there is a user story with a fixed format. Then the user story is divided into smaller sub-tasks to make the work more structured. The user story is tested on accessibility, performance, device and a user test. What went wrong with other user stories was that we did not have a clear idea of how to properly define and structure them. From this experience, we learned the importance of clearly defining user stories and breaking them down into manageable tasks from the beginning.
